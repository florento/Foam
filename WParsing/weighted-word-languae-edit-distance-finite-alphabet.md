# Weighted Word Language Edit Distance 

extend [[word-language-edit-distance-finite-alphabet]]

for $A_1, A_2 : \Sigma^*  \to S$ (power series),
$$ d(A_1, A_2) = \bigoplus_{w_1, w_2 \in \Sigma^*} 
  A_1(w_1) \otimes d(w_1, w_2) \otimes A_2(w_2)$$ 

rem: the unweighted definition is a particular case of Boolean semiring ($A_1$, $A_2$ compute the characteristic functions of $L_1$ and $L_2$).


for $\Sigma$ finite:
- for $A_1, A_2$ defined by weighted automata, computation $d(A_1, A_2)$ is presented in following paper:
  - composition and $\epsilon$-removal of Weighted Transducers
  - determinizartion of WA
  - synchronization of Weighted Transducers w. bounded delays
  - for general E.D. that can be represented by finite weighted transducers
  - on-the-fly transducer's composition & pruning.
